Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and participants in the Kaboom project, we are dedicated to cultivating an open and inclusive community. Our aim is to provide a welcoming atmosphere for all individuals who contribute through various activities, such as reporting issues, suggesting features, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and more.

We are committed to ensuring that participation in this project remains a harassment-free experience for everyone. Regardless of their experience level, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality, all individuals are treated with respect and consideration.

Unacceptable behavior by participants includes, but is not limited to:

    Engaging in personal attacks.
    Making trolling or derogatory comments, or using insults.
    Harassing individuals publicly or privately.
    Sharing private information of others, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit consent.
    Displaying unethical or unprofessional conduct.

Project maintainers hold the right and responsibility to address comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They may also temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, offensive, threatening, or harmful.

By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to consistently and fairly applying these principles to all aspects of managing the project. Any project maintainer who does not adhere to or enforce this Code of Conduct may be removed from the project team.

This Code of Conduct applies not only within project spaces but also in public spaces when an individual is representing the Kaboom project or its community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or other unacceptable behavior can be reported by reaching out to the project maintainers.

All complaints will be taken seriously and will be thoroughly reviewed and investigated. The response to each complaint will be appropriate to the circumstances. Project maintainers are committed to maintaining the confidentiality of reporters involved in incidents.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from version 1.3.0 of the Contributor Covenant, accessible at http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/3/0/.
