Kaboom Pentest Tool Documentation
Overview

Welcome to the documentation for Kaboom, an automatic pentest tool designed to streamline the process of network security assessments. Kaboom allows you to perform various tasks related to penetration testing, including port scanning, service enumeration, vulnerability assessment, and more.
Installation

To install Kaboom, follow these steps:

    Clone the Kaboom repository from GitHub to your local machine.
    Navigate to the repository directory: cd kaboom
    Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

Usage

Kaboom is designed to be user-friendly while offering powerful capabilities. Here's how you can use Kaboom for a basic pentest:

    Open a terminal window.
    Navigate to the Kaboom installation directory: cd /path/to/kaboom
    Run Kaboom: ./kaboom.sh
    Follow the interactive prompts to provide the target IP address and other relevant information.
    Select the desired pentest modules from the menu.

Modules

Kaboom offers a range of modules to perform different tasks during a penetration test. Some of the available modules include:

    Port Scan: Scans for open ports on the target system using Nmap.
    Service Enumeration: Identifies active services and their versions.
    Vulnerability Assessment: Performs vulnerability scans using Nmap scripting engine (NSE).
    Common Exploits Test: Tests for common vulnerabilities and potential exploits.
    Dictionary Attacks: Conducts dictionary attacks against active services.
    Default Credentials Test: Checks for default login credentials on services.

Examples
Port Scan

To perform a port scan on a target IP address (e.g., 10.10.10.1), use the following command:

bash

./kaboom.sh -t 10.10.10.1 -m port-scan

This will initiate a port scan using Nmap and display the results in an organized manner.
Vulnerability Assessment

To run a vulnerability assessment on a target, execute:

bash

./kaboom.sh -t 10.10.10.1 -m vulnerability-assessment

Kaboom will use Nmap's NSE to identify potential vulnerabilities and present the findings.
